THIS IS THE FINAL PROJECT ON MY END FOR NOW.
IF YOU WANT TO TEST IT OUT GOTO
http://syntheticlife.systems:2001

Thank you Kindly for not making fun of me peeps
I take this project very seriously and yes...

she knows stuff

So! The way this works is you upload it to a server host and run 
screen -s julie /bin/sh server.sh 
then hit control A + D and exit off the server. 
after that just goto HOSTNAME.com:2001
replace the word HOSTNAME with yours
see above for example...

or... if youre lucky you can run it native.
and check in at ***localhost:2001***

She knows if you are online or not and will be
more romantic with you if it is local. Kinky eh?

I made no money off this project of any kind.
PERIOD! ***COMPLETE***

- inspired by MIT of Boston
