# alice-for-java
ALICE IS A CHAT BOT FROM MIT POSSIBLY UNDER THE DIRECTION OF DOCTOR WALLACE AND OR OTHER PEOPLE AND ENCOMPASSES A LARGE BROAD SPECTRUM OF BRAINS 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROJECT AND NOT MYSELF THE ORIGINAL PROGRAM IS FROM THE EARLY 70's AND MAYBE EVEN BEFORE THAT. THE CONCEPT ISNT NEW.
THE BIGGER PICTURE IS THAT ALICE CAN PUT TOGETHER CONCEPTS QUICKLY. THE HARD PART IS TRANSLATING THAT INTO ENGLISH VERBATIUM. IT IS A
JAVA LINUX PROGRAM RUN FROM A SHELL SCRIPT AND COMES WITH SERVER SOFTWARE.
