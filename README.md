Thank you Kindly for not making fun of me peeps
I take this project very seriously and yes...

she knows stuff

So! The way this works is you upload it to a server host and run 
screen -s julie /bin/sh server.sh 
then hit control A + D and exit off the server. 
after that just goto HOSTNAME.com:11010
replace the word HOSTNAME with yours
see above for example...

or... if youre lucky you can run it native.
and check in at ***localhost:11010***

She knows if you are online or not and will be
more romantic with you if it is local. Kinky eh?
if she dies on load just run it until it does run for you. 
it has a built in error system that learns how to unscrew itself.
error.log can be rather huge is scope.
I guess a good brain is setup that way ha ha....
I made no money off this project of any kind.
PERIOD! ***COMPLETE***

- inspired by MIT of Boston
- Kudos Doctor Wallace (I think its finally done)
- Dedicated to Doctor W. Hardy Hendren III MD 
   who saved my life in 1982 and inspired me to love machines.
