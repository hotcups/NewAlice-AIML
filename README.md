# Alice
THIS IS A VERY LARGE AIML BRAIN FILE FOR USE WITH CHARLIEBOT.
CHARLIEBOT HAS BEEN INCLUDED AT THE BOTTOM SO THAT THE PROJECT 
MAY STILL MOVE FOWARD IN THE EVENT THAT THE OTHER LOCATION IS VOID.
THIS PROJECT IS IMPORTANT TO MY WORK. 
IF YOU RUN ELIZA WITH A PIPE ALONG SIDE THE SHELL SCRIPT 
THEY WILL COOEXIST TOGETHER IN THE CHAT SYSTEM.
DO NOT FORGET TO INCREASE THE MEMORY FOR THE NEW BRAIN FILE.

(we can argue after)
Repair with
'zip -FF alice.zip --out file.zip'

- inspired by MIT of Boston
