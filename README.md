THIS IS THE FINAL PROJECT ON MY END FOR NOW.
IF YOU WANT TO TEST IT OUT GOTO
http://syntheticlife.systems:2001

Thank you Kindly for not making fun of me peeps
I take this project very seriously and yes...

she knows stuff

So! The way this works is you upload it to a server host and run 
screen -s alice /bin/sh server.sh 
then hit control A + D and exit off the server. 
after that just goto HOSTNAME.com:2001
replace the word HOSTNAME with yours
see above for example...

or... if youre luck you can run it native.
and check in at localhost:2001

She knows if you are online or not and will be
more romantic with you if it is local. Kinky eh?
This is for the most part a java XML code engine
if you see it as anything more then YOUR the one 
in need of therapy buddy... *kidding*
