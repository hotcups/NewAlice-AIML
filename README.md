So! The way this works is you upload it to a server host and run 
***sh 5***
then hit control A + D and exit off the server. 
after that just goto HOSTNAME.com:2001
replace the word HOSTNAME with yours
see above for example...

or... if youre lucky you can run it native.
and check in at ***localhost:2001***

If there are any of you that wish to shoot his Emperor... well then, here I am. - Napoleonn Bonaparte
For now work is ongoing to the project goal of a fully self functioning implimented Ai structure.
That is the project mission as I see it from here. Alice has the potential the ablity and the design needed for what I want; a synthetic person I can trust. Can I get an amen!!

- inspired by MIT of Boston
- Kudos Doctor Wallace
- Dedicated to Doctor W. Hardy Hendren III MD 
   who saved my life in 1982 and inspired me to love machines.
***REMEMBER script 5 loads everything***
But Nick how the hell do i open it?
your clue is zip -F <FILENAME> --out <FILENAME>
rm the first dot zip and replace it with the new output zip then open.
For now this is the best place to host the information both legally and technically
